React.ts-Calendar
Project Overview This calendar was created for a school project as part of a larger application developed in a team of four. This specific module represents my major contribution to the project.

🚀 The Experience
This was my first time using HTML, CSS, TypeScript, and React. While I am proud of the result I achieved within the 6-month timeframe, I recognize there is significant room for growth.

🛠 Areas for Improvement
Backend & Middleware: I could have implemented a basic logger and made the backend more robust and expansive.

Styling: The CSS could use minor tweaks, and the UI/UX remains the project's biggest frontend weakness.

Functionality: Many quality-of-life upgrades could be added, such as:

Static event patterns (school/work rosters).

Importing public APIs for holidays.

Implementing Google’s API (though, as I say, "where's the fun in that?").

📈 Reflection
Overall, I'm pretty happy and proud of the resulting calendar I was able to put together within the 6 months of the project.

Why this works for your portfolio:
Visual Hierarchy: Using ## and ### headers makes it "scannable." Recruiters often spend less than 30 seconds on a README.

Transparency: Keeping your text about it being your "first time" shows honesty and a "growth mindset," which is highly valued in junior developers.

Bullet Points: Your list of improvements is now a "Roadmap," which shows you can critically analyze your own code.
