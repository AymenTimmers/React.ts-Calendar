# ℹ️ Description
This was my first time using HTML, CSS, Typescript and React so theres definitely still room for improvements. I could have implemented some middleware like a basic logger for the calendar, the backend in general could have been made more robust and expansive, the css can definitely use some minor tweaks here and there, the biggest weakness on the frontend side of the project is by far the UI and UX, and generally a lot of quality of life upgrades could have been made like implementing static event patterns like school/work rosters, importing public APIs for things like holidays. Maybe ill improve this project in the future but overall im pretty happy and proud of the resulting calendar i was able to put together within the 6 months of the project.
